# AI-Haddocks
Decoding Captain Haddock's utterances. Being a huge fan of **Tin Tin** and his adventures, 
my favourite character by far is **Cpt. Haddock**. I find him so insanely sublime. 
Moving onwards, half of the times I have no idea what he is on about, hence this project, 
which tries to decypher his utterances using AI (llama-2).

The results are intented to be pubished daily, and I am looking to improve the output with 
visuals as well. Most likely [SD](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0)

The first results are starting to appear on my own Mastodon account, which I highjacked 
for this puropuse.

Some examples of the results
```
A million scavenging sea monsters: In the book "The Adventures of Tintin" by Hergé,
Captain Haddock's statement "A million scavenging sea monsters!" is an exaggeration
and a humorous expression of his frustration and disbelief at the absurdity of the
situation he finds himself in. It is not meant to be taken literally,
but rather as a way to convey the Captain's emotions and reactions to the
events unfolding around him.
```

```
Dunderheaded coconuts:  In the book "The Adventures of Tintin" by Hergé,
Captain Haddock's comment "Dunderheaded coconuts" is a humorous insult directed at the
islanders who are acting foolishly. The term "dunderheaded" means silly or absurd, and
"coconuts" is a slang term for people from the tropics. So, Captain Haddock is implying
that the islanders are acting like silly, foolish people from the tropics.
